#Still very new to github. Seeing Project plans for what will end up here.

##Looking for mentorship and help! Markdown and a nice clean github page is on the way lol.

Studying for OSCP, network+, security+
I like coding and scriptingin: go, c, python, bash, powershell

Goals for 2022:
Pass OSCP before end of the year and go for OSWP before 2023 if possible
Archive all my old notes, scripts, as part of building cheatsheets galore
Refactor and finish projects
Contribute to communities that have helped
Learn more than basic JS and Haskell

Hopes for beyond 2022:
Application written in Haskell
OSWE path
Continue with my dream projects, I kept to myself as a self taught programmer, CS-related enthusiast of last seven years
That realised I need to be considerably better at Hacking, Datascience, functional programming and programming generally.

Currently mining all my notes and code.


CTFs - tryhackme is mostly raw text 
       - provingGround will be CherryTree screenshoted

AllTheHAckingScripts - Anything I have made or found that was useful, no exploits  


Project Plans

sguidBinEnum,sh     = testing 
TzobBoxOfSecrets    = cryptographic vision coin generator to showcase golang skills and use all the l33tcode problems and geekforgeek problems solved

gufferGopherFlow.go = buffer overflow helper tool - needs cli and some refactoring, a farting gopher upon a stack
nvmRecon.sh         = recon script to get better at bash
Gh057Nmap           = extension to Nmap to make the most evasive nmap scan possible

nexus.h             = c header file for graph theory
make an actually useful restapi in golang
