[Tryhackme Profile](https://tryhackme.com/p/nvm)

### Goals for 2022:
Pass OSCP before end of the year.

Archive all my old notes, scripts, as part of building cheatsheets galore

Refactor and finish projects

Contribute to communities that have helped

Learn more than basic JS and Haskell, and make something related my general learning of cybersecurity 

### Hopes for beyond 2022:

OSWE and other OS certs

Continue with my dream projects(most AI related that got crushed-slightly by the pandemic), I kept to myself as a self taught programmer, CS-related enthusiast of last seven years

That realised I need to be considerably better at Hacking, Datascience, functional programming and programming generally.

## Currently mining all my notes and code.

CTFs - tryhackme is mostly raw text 
     - provingGround will be CherryTree screenshoted

AllTheHackingScripts - Anything I have made or found that was useful, no exploits
