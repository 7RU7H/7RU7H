# Still very new to github. Seeing Project plans for what will end up here.
## Markdown and a nice clean github page is on the way lol.


## Looking for mentorship and help! 


## I am:
Self-taught programmer

Studying for OSCP, network+, security+

I like coding and scripting in: go, c, python, bash

Hoping improve the above and aswell powershell, js, php

https://tryhackme.com/p/nvm

### Goals for 2022:
Pass OSCP before end of the year and go for OSWP before 2023 if possible

Archive all my old notes, scripts, as part of building cheatsheets galore

Refactor and finish projects

Contribute to communities that have helped

Learn more than basic JS and Haskell, and make something related my general learning of cybersecurity 

### Hopes for beyond 2022:
Application written in Haskell

OSWE and other OS certs

Continue with my dream projects, I kept to myself as a self taught programmer, CS-related enthusiast of last seven years

That realised I need to be considerably better at Hacking, Datascience, functional programming and programming generally.

## Currently mining all my notes and code.

CTFs - tryhackme is mostly raw text 
     - provingGround will be CherryTree screenshoted

AllTheHAckingScripts - Anything I have made or found that was useful, no exploits  


## Project Plans

sguidBinsEnum.sh    = GTFObins suidguid checker - Scrolling through GTFObins and CLI  takes time currently testing 

lolbasEnum.ps1      = similar to sguidBinsEnum.sh, but for getting better a powershell and automating window privEsc

TzobBoxOfSecrets    = cryptographic vision coin generator to showcase golang skills and use all the l33tcode problems and geekforgeek problems solved

gufferGopherFlow.go = buffer overflow helper suite of scripts for binex, mostly in conjection with learn more go and binex possiblities.
                    - plans to extend with cli and some refactoring, a farting gopher upon a stack/heap
                     
nvmRecon.sh         = recon script to get better at bash, automate CTFs method, learn and add more tools
Gh057Nmap           = extension to Nmap to make the most evasive nmap scan possible

nexus.h             = c header file for graph theory

unnamed             = make an actually useful rest api in golang probably related to c2s..
